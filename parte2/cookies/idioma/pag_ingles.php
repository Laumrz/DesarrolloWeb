                <h3>Version 13.10 Release Notes</h3>
                <p>The goal in this mid-season update is to address some basic issues with the current state of LoL, specifically itemization options for marksmen and supports, problematic items for assassins, and the early game development. Additionally, we'll be making a variety of adjustments to ARAM, the Mythic Shop rotation, and introducing some new skins from the Snowdown line. Without further ado, we present to you the mid-season update!</p>

                <h3>Anivia is the First Victorious Skin of Season 13</h3>
                <p>Early in 2023, the MOBA developer revealed to the community that the ranked season would be divided into two parts. Thus, it was also confirmed that there would be two victorious skins as rewards, something unprecedented until this year. In this case, we are approaching the close of the first part of the season, and we now know that the victorious skin will be for Anivia. As always, this skin will be awarded as a prize to players who reach Gold rank or higher. However, those who do not achieve this rank can still obtain it, and we'll tell you how. As all LoL users know, historically, this skin was always awarded to players who reached Gold rank. However, this year Riot Games decided to change this, and now you can also obtain it if you fall below this rank, although you'll need to play many games.</p>
